<h2>
BOOK EIGHTH
</h2>

<pre>
  "Who could resist? Who in this universe?
  She did so breathe ambrosia, so immerse
  My fine existence in a golden clime.
  She took me like a child of suckling-time,
  And cradled me in roses. Thus condemn'd,
  The current of my former life was stemm'd,
  And to this arbitrary queen of sense
  I bow'd a tranced vassal."--KEATS, Endymion.


  "I am the resurrection and the life."
